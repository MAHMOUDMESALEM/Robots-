        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2><br>
        <pre class="text" >
          Atlas is a bipedal humanoid robot primarily developed by the American robotics company
           Boston Dynamics with funding and oversight from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research 
           Projects Agency (DARPA). The robot was initially designed for a variety of search and
           rescue tasks, and was unveiled to the public on July 11, 2013.

        Design and development:
        ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ

        The design and production of Atlas was overseen by DARPA, an agency of the United States
         Department of Defense, in cooperation with Boston Dynamics. One of the robot's hands was
         developed by Sandia National Laboratories, while the other was developed by iRobot.
         In 2013, DARPA program manager Gill Pratt compared the prototype version of Atlas to a small
         child, saying that "a 1-year-old child can barely walk, a 1-year-old child falls down a lot
         this is where we are right now".

        Atlas is based on Boston Dynamics' earlier PETMAN humanoid robot, and is illuminated with
         blue LEDs. Atlas is equipped with two vision systems – a laser rangefinder and stereo
         cameras, both controlled by an off-board computer – and has hands with fine motor skill
         capabilities. Its limbs possess a total of 28 degrees of freedom. Atlas can navigate
         rough terrain and climb independently using its arms and legs, although the 2013
         prototype version was tethered to an outside power supply.

        In October 2013 Boston Dynamics uploaded a video showing Atlas could withstand being hit
         by projectiles and balance on one leg.

        In 2014, Atlas robots programmed by six different teams competed in the DARPA Robotics
         Challenge to test the robot's ability to perform various tasks, including getting in
         and out of a vehicle and driving it, opening a door, and using a power tool. A variety
         of other robots also competed. The contest was inspired by the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi
         nuclear disaster, and carries a USD 2 million prize for the winning team.

        In the 2015 DARPA robotics finals Atlas from IHMC Robotics (named Running Man) came
         second behind the Korean team Kaist and their robot DRC-Hubo by a margin of six minutes,
         completing the entire course in a time of 50:26.

        Atlas, The Next Generation:
        ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ
        On February 23, 2016, Boston Dynamics released video of a new version Atlas robot on
         YouTube. The new version of Atlas is designed to operate both outdoors and inside
         buildings. It is specialized for mobile manipulation and is very adept at walking over
         a wide range of terrain, including snow, and can do back flips and cartwheels. It is
         electrically powered and hydraulically actuated. It uses sensors in its body and legs
         to balance, and it uses LIDAR and stereo sensors in its head to avoid obstacles, assess
         the terrain, help with navigation, and manipulate objects, even when the objects are
         being moved. This version of Atlas is 150 cm (4 ft 11 in)[8] tall and weighs 80 kg 
         (180 lb).

        What's new, Atlas?:
        ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ
        On November 16, 2017, Boston Dynamics released an update video of the Atlas robot to
         YouTube. In this video Atlas was shown jumping on boxes, turning 180 degrees while
         jumping and performing a backflip.

        On May 10, 2018, Boston Dynamics released an update video of the Atlas robot to YouTube.
         In this video, Atlas was shown running across grass on an uneven terrain as well as jumping
         over a log lying on the grass.
        
        On October 12, 2018, Boston Dynamics released an update video of the Atlas robot to YouTube.[11] In this video, Atlas was shown running around while jumping over boxes.
         On September 24, 2019, Boston Dynamics released another update video of the Atlas robot
         to YouTube. In this video, Atlas was shown performing something akin to a floor routine
         in gymnastics. The robot demonstrates the ability to perform a handstand, somersaults,
         and rotations all in fluid succession. Boston Dynamics claims the robot was trained
         using "new techniques that streamline the development process."
        
        On December 29, 2020, Boston Dynamics released a music video featuring two Atlas robots,
        a Spot robot, and a Handle robot performing a dance routine to the song "Do You Love Me".
        
        
        On August 17, 2021, Boston Dynamics released a video of two Atlas robots running a Parkour
         course with jumps, balance beams, and vaults.[14] In another video released the same day,
         it is mentioned that Atlas is 5 feet tall (1.5m) and weights 190 pounds (85kg). Atlas is
         battery powered and hydraullically actuated with 20 degrees of freedom. It has RGB 
         cameras and depth sensors which provide input to its control system. All the computation
         required for control perception and estimation happen in three onboard computers.

            Applications:
            ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ
            Atlas is intended to aid emergency services in search and rescue operations,
             performing tasks such as shutting off valves, opening doors and operating powered
             equipment in environments where humans could not survive.The Department of Defense
             stated in 2013 that it had no interest in using the robot for offensive or
             defensive warfare.

           In the 2015 DARPA competition of robotics, Atlas was able to complete all eight tasks
           as follows:

          1- Drive a utility vehicle at the site.
          2- Travel dismounted across rubble.
          3- Remove debris blocking an entryway.
          4-Open a door and enter a building.
          5-Climb an industrial ladder and traverse an industrial walkway.
          6- Use a tool to break through a concrete panel.
          7-Locate and close a valve near a leaking pipe.
          8- Connect a fire hose to a standpipe and turn on a valve.
