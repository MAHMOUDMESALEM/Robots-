        <pre class="text" >

        Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics.
         Sophia was activated on February 14, 2016,and made her first public appearance at South by Southwest Festival
         (SXSW) in mid-March 2016 in Austin, Texas, United States.

        Sophia has been covered by media around the globe and has participated in many high-profile interviews.
         In October 2017, Sophia "became" a Saudi Arabian citizen, the first robot to receive citizenship of any country.
         In November 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations Development Programme's first ever Innovation Champion
         and is the first non-human to be given any United Nation title.

        History:
        ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــ

        Sophia was first activated on February 14, 2016. The robot, modeled after the ancient Egyptian Queen Nefertiti,
          Audrey Hepburn, and her inventor's wife, Amanda Hanson,is known for human-like appearance and behavior
          compared to previous robotic variants. As of 2018, Sophia's architecture includes scripting software, a chat
          system, and OpenCog, an AI system designed for general reasoning.Sophia imitates human gestures and facial 
          expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics(e.g
          on the weather).Sophia uses speech recognition technology from Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google) and is
          "designed to get smarter over time". Her speech synthesis ability is provided by Cereproc's Text-to-Speech
          engine and also allows her to sing. Sophia's intelligence software is designed by Hanson Robotics.The AI
          program analyses conversations and extracts data that allows it to improve responses in the future.

        Hanson designed Sophia to be a suitable companion for the elderly at nursing homes, or to help crowds at
         large events or parks. He has said that he hopes that the robot can ultimately interact with other humans 
         sufficiently to gain social skills. Sophia is marketed as a "social robot" that can mimic social behavior and induce feelings of love in humans.[1][16]
        
        Sophia has at least nine robot humanoid "siblings" who were also created by Hanson Robotics.Fellow Hanson 
        robots are Alice, Albert Einstein Hubo, BINA48, Han, Jules, Professor Einstein, Philip K. Dick Android, Zeno
        ,nd Joey Chaos.Around 2019–20, Hanson released "Little Sophia" as a companion that could teach children how to 
        code, including support for Python, Blockly, and Raspberry Pi.

        Features:
        ـــــــــــــــــــــــــ
        Cameras within Sophia's eyes combined with computer algorithms allow her to see. She can follow faces,
         sustain eye contact, and recognize individuals. She is able to process speech and have conversations using a
         natural language subsystem. Around January 2018, Sophia was upgraded with functional legs and the ability to
         walk. CNBC has commented on Sophia's "lifelike" skin and her ability to emulate more than 60 facial
         expressions.

        Sophia is conceptually similar to the computer program ELIZA, which was one of the first attempts at
         simulating a human conversation.The software has been programmed to give pre-written responses to specific
         questions or phrases, like a chatbot. These responses are used to create the illusion that the robot is able
         to understand conversation, including stock answers to questions like "Is the door open or shut?" In 2017 Hanson
         Robotics announced plans to open Sophia to a cloud environment using a decentralized blockchain marketplace.
         

        David Hanson has said that Sophia would ultimately be a good fit to serve in healthcare, customer service,
         therapy and education.[26] In 2019 Sophia displayed the ability to create drawings, including portraits.

         Public figure:
         ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ
         On November 21, 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations Development Programme's first-ever Innovation
          Champion for Asia and the Pacific.The announcement was made at the Responsible Business Forum in Singapore,
          an event hosted by the UNDP in Asia and the Pacific and Global Initiatives. As part of her role, Sophia will
          help to unlock innovation to work toward achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. On stage,
          she was assigned her first task by UNDP Asia Pacific Chief of Policy and Program, Jaco Cilliers.

        Sophia has appeared on CBS 60 Minutes with Charlie Rose, Good Morning Britain with Piers Morgan, and outlets
         like CNBC, Forbes, Mashable, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Guardian, and the Tonight Show 
         Starring Jimmy Fallon. Sophia was featured in AUDI's annual report and was on the cover of ELLE Brasil
         magazine. Sophia has also appeared in videos and music videos, including The White King, and as the lead female
         character in pop singer Leehom Wang’s music video A.I.

        A Sophia lookalike was portrayed by drag queen Gigi Goode in the "Snatch Game" episode of the twelfth season
         of RuPaul’s Drag Race. Goode won the episode with her character "Maria the Robot", based heavily on Sophia
         and named after a robot featured in the Fritz Lang film Metropolis.
