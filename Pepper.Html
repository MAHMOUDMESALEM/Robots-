        <pre class="text" >

          Pepper is a semi-humanoid robot manufactured by SoftBank Robotics (formerly Aldebaran
           Robotics), designed with the ability to read emotions. It was introduced in a
           conference on 5 June 2014, and was showcased in SoftBank Mobile phone stores in 
           Japan beginning the next day. Pepper's ability to recognize emotion is based on 
           detection and analysis of facial expressions and voice tones. Production of Pepper was
           paused in June 2021, due to weak demand.

        History:
        ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــ

        Pepper was introduced in Tokyo on June 5, 2014 by Masayoshi Son, founder of SoftBank.

        Pepper was scheduled to be available in December 2015 at SoftBank Mobile stores.
         Pepper went on sale in June 2015 with the first batch of 1,000 units selling out in 
         just 60 seconds.
        
        Pepper was launched in the UK in 2016.
        
        By May 2018, 12,000 Pepper robots had been sold in Europe.
        
        In June 2021, it was reported SoftBank would pause production of Pepper, citing weak
         demand. At the time, an estimated 27,000 units had been manufactured.

        Academic:
        ـــــــــــــــــــــــــ
        Pepper is available as a research and educational robot for schools, colleges and
         universities to teach programming and conduct research into human-robot interactions.

        In 2017, an international team began research into using Pepper as versatile robot to
         help look after older people in care homes or sheltered accommodation. The project
         CARESSES aimed at developing the world’s first culturally-competent robot, received 
         funding worth more than two million Euros, with donors including the European Union 
         and the Japanese government. The project was expected to run for three years. 
         Institutions involved in the research include University of Genoa (Project Coordinator),
         Örebro University, Middlesex University, the University of Bedfordshire, SoftBank Robotics,
         Advinia HealthCare, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (Japanese coordinator
         ), Nagoya University, Chubu University.[18] On Tuesday 16 October 2018, a Pepper robot
         mentioned the CARESSES project while giving evidence to the Education Committee of the
         House of Commons of the United Kingdom Parliament.

          Purpose:
         ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ
         Pepper is not a functional robot for domestic use. Instead, Pepper is intended "to make
          people enjoy life", enhance people's lives, facilitate relationships, have fun with
          people and connect people with the outside world. Pepper's creators hope that
          independent developers will create new content and uses for Pepper.

            Specifications:
            ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ
            The robot's head has four microphones, two HD cameras (in the mouth and forehead),
             and a 3-D depth sensor (behind the eyes). There is a gyroscope in the torso and
             touch sensors in the head and hands. The mobile base has two sonars, six lasers,
             three bumper sensors, and a gyroscope
